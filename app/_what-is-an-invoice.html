                                In international commercial practice, invoice is a document which provided by the seller to the buyer containing a list of goods and services, their quantity, price at which they were delivered to the buyer, formal features of the products (color, weight, etc.), terms of delivery, and information about the sender and the recipient.

                            <p class="receipt-vs-invoice-info-text">Invoice is a document that regulates trade relations between the seller and the buyer. It consists of a written agreement between the parties to the transaction, which helps avoid further complaints or fraud on both sides. It is possible to enter into commodity relations without an invoice. But then, of course, at the legislative level, it is impossible to prove any offenses on both sides in their presence. In this case, an invoice is a binding document between the seller and the buyer when a deal must be concluded.</p>
